    <center><p><b><u>Game Details</b></u><p>

    Genre       :-  The game will be a Visual Novel Style Dating Simulator.<br>

    <p>Setup        :- The game will be taking place in the Maldives.
    It won't be limited to a specific island only. Although this
    might change as the story is made and progressed further.
    There will be one main character and accompanying side characters to the
    story line.</p>

    <p>Mechanics:- The game will have a main plot that presents the main character
      AKA the user with unique choices to progress through the story. This is the
      type of read and select the choice type of games that most dating sims offer.
      The game will be targeted to be played OFFLINE.</p>

    <p>Features   :- These above mentioned main plot and the choices accompanying
      it will have music to go with it as well. Music that is well suited to what
      is appearing and what will be appearing on the screen. For example if a sad
      scene is coming up a sad music tone will be played. And like that with other
      scenarios as well.</p>

    <p>Others      :- The game will be taking a lot of bits and pieces from
      Maldivian movies and dramas so that more people can relate to it. Music will
      also be a bit Maldivian themed as that will go with the story we will be
       telling more easily. It will be more focused on the modern day Maldives
       rather than the days of old.</p>
